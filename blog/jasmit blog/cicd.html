              <p class="card-text">By integrating Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring tools, and DevSecOps practices, a CI/CD pipeline ensures continuous integration, delivery, and deployment of applications while maintaining high security standards and real-time monitoring. This approach enhances software quality, reduces time to market, and ensures robust security compliance.</p>
              <p class="card-text">1. Continuous Integration (CI) with Jenkins
                Code Commit: Developers push code to a version control system (e.g., Git).
                Build Automation: Jenkins automatically triggers builds when code changes are detected. It compiles the code, runs unit tests, and packages the application.
                Artifact Storage: Successful builds are stored in an artifact repository (e.g., JFrog Artifactory).</p>
               <p class="card-text">2. Containerization with Docker
                Docker Images: Jenkins uses Docker to build images from the application code, ensuring consistency across different environments.
                Version Control: Docker images are tagged with version numbers and stored in a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub).  </p>
               <p class="card-text">3. Continuous Deployment (CD) with Kubernetes
                Cluster Management: Kubernetes orchestrates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
                Deployment Automation: Jenkins integrates with Kubernetes to automate the deployment process, using manifests or Helm charts to manage releases.
                Scaling and Rollbacks: Kubernetes handles scaling based on demand and can roll back to previous versions if issues are detected.  </p>
               <p class="card-text"> 4. Monitoring
                Metrics Collection: Tools like Prometheus collect metrics on application performance and infrastructure health.
                Visualization: Grafana displays metrics in dashboards, providing real-time insights.
                Alerts: Alerts are configured to notify teams of any anomalies or performance issues.
                 </p>
               <p class="card-text"> 5. DevSecOps Integration
                Security Scanning: Jenkins pipelines include security scanning tools (e.g., Snyk, OWASP ZAP) to detect vulnerabilities early in the development process.
                Compliance Checks: Automated compliance checks ensure that the code meets security and regulatory standards.
                Continuous Monitoring: Security monitoring tools continuously assess the production environment for threats and vulnerabilities </p>
               <p class="card-text">  Summary
                By integrating Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring tools, and DevSecOps practices, a CI/CD pipeline ensures continuous integration, delivery, and deployment of applications while maintaining high security standards and real-time monitoring. This approach enhances software quality, reduces time to market, and ensures robust security compliance.</p>
